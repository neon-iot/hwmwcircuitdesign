# Hardware and Microwave Circuit design for IoT
## About this course

This course deals with the design of Microwave devices that give form to the Hardware asociated to IoT systems, which essentially operates at high frequencies like Microwaves and Milimetric Waves.
The design is based on distributed parameters and also on the well known Scattering parameters, the "S" parameters.
Directional Couplers, Amplifiers, Filters, Oacilators, Conerters, Matching Networks, as usually part of the different devices used for IoT, like LoRa, ZeegBee and SDR devices.

## Main topics

Intruduction to distributed parameters.

Transmission Lines.

Coupled Transmission Lines. Even and Odd Modes.

Matching Networks.

Directional Couplers.

RF Amplifiers Design. Low Noise Amplifiers (LNA).

Oscilators.

Converters.

Filter Design.

Microstrip Filters Design.

Splitters y Combiners

## What you will learn
This course will provide the student with a deep knowledge of the Design of Microwave Devices, in order to allw Her/Him to the development and design of IoT Hardware, as well as a comprehension of the principles of functioning of already existing IoT Hardware Devices and commercially availables.

## What you will need:
Basic Knowledge of Circuit Design Theory, preferably design with distributed parameters. If required, a brief introductory chapter about transmission lines and distributed circuits design can be provided at the beginning of the course.
