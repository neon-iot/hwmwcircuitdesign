## About this course

This course deals with the design of Microwave devices that give form to the Hardware asociated to IoT systems, which essentially operates at high frequencies like Microwaves and Milimetric Waves.
The design is based on distributed parameters and also on the well known Scattering parameters, the "S" parameters.
Directional Couplers, Amplifiers, Filters, Oacilators, Conerters, Matching Networks, as usually part of the different devices used for IoT, like LoRa, ZeegBee and SDR devices.
